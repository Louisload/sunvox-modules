# Sunvox modules

This repository is home of some sunvox modules I've been working on while playing around with sunvox. Hopefully they're useful for others as well!

Contains:
- VangelisVox: based on the signature Vangelis sound, as heard in BladeRunner, Voices, Conquest of Paradise, and so many others; (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVynPDxcuK8)
- Neratzoula: based on yet-another Vangelis sound, found on a song he made with Irene Papas called Neratzoula. It's very nice to play this with a touch-based controller connected to the Vibrato.
- More to come...
